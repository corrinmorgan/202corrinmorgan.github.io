                <p class = "leftie">     I'm a twenty-something year old from Hampton,Virginia. 
                    I recently moved to California to pursue the Master of Information Management 
                    (with a concentration in User Experience Design) from UC Berkeley. 
                    My background in graphic design and marketing has been cultivated while working 
                    for two different cultural arts centers over nine years. 
                    I have a deep love and appreciation for the visual and performing arts and 
                    hope to one day open my own gallery. When I'm able to look away from a screen, 
                    I'm usually singing karaoke, visiting a museum, or trying a new restaurant.      </p>

                    <h3 class ="leftie"> My Professional Passions:</h3>
                    <p class = "leftie"> During my time at UC Berkeley, I hope to become a more proficient designer.
                        I am passionate about designing products for those who care for people with
                        severe mental illnesses and disabilities with abrupt onsets. It can be a very
                        isolating and draining experience but products designed to foster community and support for
                        these people are few and far between. I'm interested to hear about their needs and
                        hopefully deliver something that can assist them with making day-to-day life 
                        a little easier.
                    </p>
                    <p class = "leftie"> 
                        Another (lighter) idea that I would like to work on is developing a product for fellow
                        perfume addicts. I am a relatively new collector but there is a hole in the market for 
                        developing a product that can help collectors organize their collection and find new
                        perfumes to try.
